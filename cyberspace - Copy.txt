Cyberspace is a concept describing a widespread interconnected digital technology.
 "The expression dates back from the first decade of the diffusion of the internet. 
 It refers to the online world as a world 'apart', as distinct from everyday reality.
 In cyberspace people can hide behind fake identities, as in the famous The New Yorker cartoon.
 " (Delfanti, Arvidsson, 150) The term entered popular culture from science fiction and the arts but 
 is now used by technology strategists, security professionals, government, military and industry leaders and entrepreneurs
to describe the domain of the global technology environment, commonly defined as standing for the global network of interdependent
information technology infrastructures, telecommunications networks and computer processing systems.
Others consider cyberspace to be just a notional environment in which communication over computer networks occurs.
The word became popular in the 1990s when the use of the Internet, networking, and digital communication were all growing dramatically; 
the term cyberspace was able to represent the many new ideas and phenomena that were emerging.
